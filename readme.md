# Duck Duck Go + (Proxied) Google Suggests

This project creates OpenSearch Plugins that combine [Duck Duck Go](http://duckduckgo.com/) searches with [Google Suggestions](http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=106230). It optionally proxies the suggestions via a node.js server to restore the !bangs that Google removes from the suggestions.

About !bangs: [http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html](http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html)

## ⚠️ Deprecated

Now that Duck Duck Go offers their own search suggestions, this project is deprecated an no longer maintained or supported.


## Installation / Server Configuration:

Installing this script is almost as simple as downloading it to a directory and running it. You'll need to do two things to get it ready:

* find-and-replace "ddgg.nfriedly.com" with your site's url in `index.html` and `ddg-google-proxied.xml`.
* update or delete the Google Analytics code at the bottom of `index.html`

After that, run 
    node server.js
And your server should be up and running on port 8080!

### Deployment to Heroku

This should be runnable for free on Heroku
